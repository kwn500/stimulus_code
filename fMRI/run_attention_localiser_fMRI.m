function Run_MID_attn_localiser (SubjCode, runNumber)

%The localiser for the MID attention stimulus: used to define the area containing the stimulus
%and the region outside it!
%Radial checkerboard pattern that expands logarithmically.
%Modified (simpler) version of Run_EoO_localiser_1.m
%The scan runs for 7 cycles of 4-TR blocks (12 s)
%one full cycle is Fixation | Inner | Fixation | Outer5
%So that's 4 TRs * 4 blocks = 16 TR cycle
%Which is 16 TRs * 7 cycles = 112 TRs + one final Fixation block at the end
% = 112+4 = 116 TRs = 116 * 3 s = 348 s = 3 min 48 s duration
%There are no dummy TRs at the beginning or end (fixation blocks should be enough).
%R Maloney, Nov 2015

% Version _2 differs from Version 1 in that the Vpixx device calls are made (even though
% there are no dichoptic aspects), because Version 1 was missing frames in the scanner...not sure why but maybe this will help.
